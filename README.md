# Automatic doc generation
Forked repository to automatically discover events and document them

##

We are using fargate in this project to do run a upload the apiasync docs. See diagram below.

## environmental variables
Names located in the .env-example file. EVENT_BUS_NAME, SCHEMA_REGISTRY_NAME, and REGION should be the values bellow (for sandbox). EVENT_BUS_NAME should be adjusted depending on the environment we are in.
```
export EVENT_BUS_NAME=SANDBOX-EventCentral
export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_NAME=discovered-schemas
export REGION=us-west-2
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

# The problem

Event-Driven Architectures allow us to scale, be agile and keep our architecture decoupled. Ultimately I believe they help us work more efficiently.

When starting off with Event-Driven Architectures we spend time discovering our core business events, writing code to match them and maintain versions going forward.

Over a period of time more events are added to our domain, requirements change, and our architecture scales.

It can become difficult to know and understand what events are flowing within our domain.

I'm a huge fan of Amazon EventBridge and I wrote this tool to help engineers gain and keep an understanding of events that flow through their domain.

# This solution

EventBridge atlas uses [parsers](https://eventbridge-atlas.netlify.app/docs/parsers/intro) t

EventBridge atlas uses a combination of open source tools to automatically generate documentation for engineers.

EventBridge Atlas downloads your schemas and parses them into various different outputs (you decide) and ouputs static HTML. So you can host your documentation anywhere!

You can read more on [how it works on the website](https://eventbridge-atlas.netlify.app/docs/how-it-works)

# Getting Started

You should be able to get setup within minutes if you head over to our documentation to get started üëá

# Examples

Here are some screenshots of examples of what EventBridge Atlas can produce using its parsers.

Your AWS Schemas are transformed into the following documentation tools:
